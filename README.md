# Welcome to ACS

- Make sure to have sqlite3 and make installed
- There are 2 targets for compilation, first client and the second is the server.
- To compile the serevr just run the following command:
```bash
make TARGET=server
```
- To the client just run the following command:
```bash
make TARGET=client
```
 Follow the instructions on the server to set it up.

 The client is easy and straight forward to use.
